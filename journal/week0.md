# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

Going through this weeks homework was definintely fun and challenging. I was able to work through the issues and things that I was not good at when it comes to Lucid Chart. I also, got to learn more about Gitpod which is a really amazing tool.

Being able to work through some issues and fight through mistakes has made this learning experience so far really enjoyable. I am really enjoy working in the AWS Console to creat new things and brush up on my skills. Below are my Crudder Conceptual and Architectual diagrams.
