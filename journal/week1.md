# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

For week one I was able to get all the docker containerization up and working for the Cruddur app. The instructions were definitely something that was very informative and helped me learn even more from the experience. I was able to create a Docker account to keep all my images that I have been using. I learned more about some security tooling like Snyk, and Clair. 

I learned more about how to properly create a multi-container setup, as well as, the importance of making sure all dependencies of the app are downloaded, making sure ports on the containers are properly exposed and setting Environment Variables. All of these things were paramount to getting this project successfully up and running. 

Some of my stretch goals for this week was to run some scans and make changes based on what was recommended on the images I was running with Snyk (I did have act on these initially but because it causes issues later on in the project I went back to the base image we have been using). I also studied more about Postgres SQL and the specific commands that help you navigate and query the database.
