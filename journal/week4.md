# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

This week has been quite the doozy in learning how to connect multiple services together and make sure that we were able to have proper communication to all the services. I was able to follow along and get everything connected but it was very difficult to sift through some of the errors that I was having. The biggest issues I had was when I was getting an Invalid Code error when I initially got the confirmation code from Cognito and the timeout issue that I was experiencing. Both of them caused me to dig deep into documentation and try different things until I was able to get to the answers needed to move forward. 

I was able to continue using the us-east-1 for my region and make some subtle tweaks to my code to help make sure that things were being developed as I wanted it. I am learning through this process, that even though it is a bootcamp and we all are building the same things, I want to make sure that I am putting my little touches and flair on things so that I can speak to how to do even the little things when it comes to this project.
